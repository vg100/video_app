1. What's your favourite state management library for react and why?
Redux is used so that we can create a global state which can be accessed from anywhere.So in that case we need to call API's less no of times & also updating value from one component updates the value in all other components too.
- When using redux with React,states will no longer need to be lifted up.
- This make it easier for you to trace which action causes any chnages.
- Redux is maintainable.
- debugging is easy in redux
- easy to testing.

2. Write some react native best practices?
- Use atomic Design helps to build consistent, solid, and reusable design systems.
- Lock your library dependencies.
- create a separate function to render the react native elements.
- use global variable for font size & color.
- create a separate file for logic building.
- use propTypes.

3.Which coding style you prefer wet or dry and why?
- I preferd DRY(Don't repeat yourself) coding Style.
